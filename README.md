## Project Description
Guess the number is an interactive voice-activated guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 1000, and players use their voice to guess the number. Utilizing the Web Speech API for voice recognition, this game offers a unique and engaging way to interact with technology. Players receive immediate auditory feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes the computer's microphone to listen to the player's guesses, providing a hands-free gaming experience.
- **Random Number Generator**: At the start of each game session, the computer automatically selects a random number between 1 and 1000.
- **Web Speech API Integration**: Connects to the Web Speech API to enable real-time voice recognition and processing.
- **Dynamic Feedback System**: Offers clues if the guessed number is higher or lower than the target. Once the correct number is guessed, the game announces the success and presents an option to play again with a new number.
